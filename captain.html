<center><bold>FAQ</bold> <br>
<br>
<bold><h>Q: What is this? </h> <br></bold>
A: This is a summer basketball league you have been invited to. Luckily for you, you have been invited to be captain of a 5-7 man roster.  The league is being run by Rahul B, but if you have any question text either him or Andres A and we can answer your questions.<br>
<br>
<h><bold>Q: How often do teams play? </h></bold> <br>
A: The plan is 2 games per week.<br>
<br>
<bold><h>Q: How many teams will their be? </h> <br></bold>
A: There is a plan to be 6 teams. <br>
<br>

<bold><h>Q: What if teammates can't show up for a game? </h> <br></bold>
A:  Let's say my team has 2 people going out of town for this week's games, then for this week I will tell my opponent instead of 5 on 5 we will do 3 on 3.<br>
<br>

<bold><h>Q: Why do we need a league? </h> <br></bold>
A: It has been evident that the only way we can get stuff done if by having a structured system or else people will flake. (*wink wink) <br>
<br>

<bold><h>Q: How do I choose my team?</h><br></bold>
A: Since you were lucky enough to be chosen as a team captain, I ask you to choose 5-7 members to join your team.  Remember that this is for fun so try to choose people who will not be overly aggresive and will take this out of porportions.  Simarly we have a rule to ensure as a team captain you are allowed only one real basketball player on your team.  If there is any question on if a player can join your team please ask Rahul.<br>
